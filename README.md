# `üìå Getting Started with Delance`


## üëë About the Project
With the exceeding pace of growth of the human species, the basic need of earning money for survival increases. The existing freelance and all other mainstream online job marketplaces have taken a turn for worse for both clients and freelancers. These giant conglomerates tend to adopt profit-centric policymaking which adversely affects smooth and reliable experience mainly for freelancers and job seekers. Some problems include difficulty in receiving payments, extremely high fees, biased feedback, and unexpected suspension of accounts, amongst others.

Adressing the discontent of such people, we came forward with the idea of Delance. It is a decentralized freelance platform, where you can `post a project/job`, `browse jobs`, `search jobs`, `bid upon existing projects` & `chat` with the freelancer.


#### Salient Features:
* You need to connect your `Metamask wallet` to perform these operations.
* In order to bid on a project, write a brief summary and quote your price in the popup.
* Project Publisher/Employer has the option to see all placed bids to choose from.
* They can view each bid and can select their desired applicant.
* As a freelancer/job-seeker, in case you get lucky enough that your bid gets accepted, you'll then be able to see that project in 'My Projects' field.
* For a publisher, they can see a list of all their posted projects on 'My Projects' page.
* After completing the project, you've an option to add the files (TBA). And once the job-poster/publisher makes sure that the project is complete, the funds are released to the freelancer.

## üíÅ Available Scripts - Manual

In the project directory, you can run:

### `‚õÉ run backend`
To run the backend of our project, you need to open the terminal/command line in server folder and run the following command:
`nodemon index.js`
After executing this command. Backend will be running on port `8080`

### `‚õè compile smart contract`
- To compile the smart contract, make sure you have the `Truffle Suite` set up and running.
- Now type the following commands:
- `truffle init` then `truffle compile`
- Before running these commands, make sure Ganache is running. It is a private `Ethereum blockchain environment` that allows you to emulate the Ethereum blockchain to be able to interact with smart contracts.

### `‚úÖ npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see some lint errors in the console.

### `ü§ñ npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `üí™ npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `‚ùé npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
